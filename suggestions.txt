Comments:
I like how you included the errors that are put out into your feedback, we just said the count, but ig yours also works!
I like how short your code is, as it makes it aesthetically pleasing (nice to look at) and also is probably taking up less space.

Constructive feedback from Alessio: I like how you implemented it. Potentially you could removed "Exit code: 1" from output, since the error has already been stated. But overall, very good job!
